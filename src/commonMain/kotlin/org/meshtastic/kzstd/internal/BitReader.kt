/**
 * Backward bit reader for zstd FSE / Huffman bitstreams (RFC 8878 §4.1.1).
 *
 * Zstd writes these streams to be consumed from the END toward the start: the
 * last byte's highest set bit is a stop-bit sentinel marking the true end of
 * the meaningful bits. Reading begins at the bit just below the stop bit and
 * proceeds MSB-to-LSB, walking backward through the bytes. The first bit
 * consumed is the most-significant bit of the returned field.
 *
 * This is a deliberately simple bit-at-a-time model: it precomputes the global
 * bit index of the bit immediately below the stop bit, then serves bits by
 * decrementing that index. zstd payloads here are <= 4096 bytes, so the
 * per-bit cost is irrelevant and correctness is maximised. The interface is
 * **peek + skip** so FSE (fixed-width transitions) and Huffman (variable-width
 * canonical codes) can share one cursor when interleaved.
 *
 * Reads past the stream start return zero bits (zstd's defined zero-padding)
 * and set [overflowed]; callers use that to terminate symbol decode loops.
