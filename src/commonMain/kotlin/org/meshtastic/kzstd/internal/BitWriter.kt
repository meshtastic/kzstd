/**
 * Backward bit writer — the exact inverse of [ReverseBitReader].
 *
 * zstd FSE / Huffman bitstreams are consumed from the END toward the start:
 * [ReverseBitReader] finds the highest set bit of the last byte (the "stop bit"
 * sentinel), then reads bits MSB-first walking downward toward the stream start.
 * The first bit the decoder reads sits just below the stop bit (the highest
 * meaningful position); the last bit it reads sits at the very start.
 *
 * So the WRITER must lay bits down from the start upward: each [writeBits] call
 * appends a field whose low-order bit lands at the current (lower) global
 * position and whose high-order bit lands at the next (higher) position. Because
 * the decoder reads from the top down, the field's MSB is read first — matching
 * [ReverseBitReader.peekBits] returning bits MSB-first. The net effect: fields
 * written in order `f0, f1, … fk` are read back by the decoder in REVERSE order
 * `fk, … f1, f0`. Callers therefore write the entire bitstream in reverse of the
 * decode read order, then [finish] appends the stop bit at the very top.
 *
 * Pure common Kotlin — no `java.*`, no `expect/actual` — so it can back the
 * wasmWasi compress path.
