/**
 * Finite State Entropy (FSE) ENCODING table — the inverse of the decode-side
 * [FseTable]. It is derived **from the very decode table the [FseTable.build]
 * routine produces**, so an encoded stream is provably consumable by this
 * decoder (and by libzstd, which builds the identical decode table from the same
 * normalized distribution).
 *
 * ## How encoding mirrors decoding
 *
 * The decoder keeps a state in `[0, tableSize)`. In decode-state `ds` it emits
 * `symbol[ds]`, then transitions: `next = newState[ds] + readBits(nbBits[ds])`.
 * The set of `next` values reachable from all decode-states that emit a given
 * symbol `s` tiles `[0, tableSize)` exactly (the FSE invariant).
 *
 * Encoding runs the symbol stream in REVERSE (last symbol first). The encoder
 * holds a `state` that equals the decode-state which will emit the symbol it is
 * about to encode. To encode symbol `s` while currently at `state = t` (where
 * `t` is the decode-state that emits the NEXT, already-encoded symbol), it:
 *   1. finds the unique decode-state `ds` with `symbol[ds] == s` whose output
 *      range `[newState[ds], newState[ds] + 2^nbBits[ds])` contains `t`,
 *   2. emits the low `nbBits[ds]` bits of `t - newState[ds]`,
 *   3. sets `state = ds`.
 * Because the writer is the backward [ReverseBitWriter], emitting in reverse
 * symbol order yields a stream the decoder reads in forward order.
 *
 * The very first thing the decoder reads is the initial state (`tableLog` bits),
 * which equals the encoder's FINAL `state` after the whole (reversed) stream —
 * so the encoder writes that state last.
 *
 * This table is built once per (distribution, tableLog); for the predefined
 * tables the SDK uses, it is cached.
